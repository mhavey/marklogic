# Movie Example

## Intro
This movie data model examples shows how various types of UML class relationships are modeled in MarkLogic in an Entity Services model. It also explains shows how to use Template-Driven Extraction (TDE) to build SQL views of this data.

## Models
Here is the MagicDraw model:

## The Cooking Show Approach

Like a cooking show, this example describes how to prepare the souffle but also gives a souffle already prepred for you to consume. 

The "prepared" souffle includes:
- The UML model.
- MLCP gradle tasks to ingest the movie source data and transform it to the form of the model
- ES instance converter already modified to address source-to-model mapping issues. Used in MLCP tasks.
- TDE template already modified to present views using the relationships specified in the UML mode.

If you were to start from scratch, you would follow this recipe:
- Devise the UML model in your favorite UML editor.
- Use the XMI to ES transformation to map the UML model to Entity Services. 
- From the Entity Services model, generate the instance converter and TDE template.
- Tweak the instance converter to propertly map source fields to model fields. 
- Tweak the TDE template to adjust the views as needed.
- In your gradle build file, add MLCP tasks to ingest department and employee data. 

## How to run:

Our project uses gradle. Before running, view the settings in gradle.properties. Create a file called gradle-local.properties and in this file override any of the properties from gradle.properties.

Here are the steps to setup.

### Setup DB
Setup new DB. Will use basic DB config with no indexes. Will bring in XMI2ES transform to our modules.

Run the following:

gradle -PenvironmentName=local -i setup deleteGenerated useInitialDBConfig mlDeploy

Confirm:
- Content DB is empty and has no element range indexes
- Schemas DB contains:
  * /MovieModel-0.0.1.tdex - our "pre-cooked" TDE template
- Modules DB has these modules
  * /xmi2es/xmi2esTransform.xqy - Main module of the toolkit's transform
  * /ext/entity-services/MovieModel-0.0.1.xqy - Converter module for movies. It was generated by ES but tweaked. Pre cooked!
  * /xmi2es/loadMovieTransformation.xqy - MLCP transform: on ingest of movie source data invokes ES converter module

### Edit the uml2es.gradle to enable index and TDE generation
In the previous step you copied the uml2es.gradle file from the toolkit's uml2esTransform folder. That file is configured to disable TDE and index generation for the ES model. We want TDE and index generation, so let's turn it on. Edit the uml2es.gradle file in this project folder. Change the last block by setting generatedInstanceConverter, generateDatabaseProperties, and generateExtractionTemplate to true. 

Here is what that block should look like:

/*
Edit this to enable/disable code generation of mlGenerateModelArtifacts
*/
ext {   
  def mdb = project.findProperty("mlFinalDbName")
  if (mdb == null) mdb = project.findProperty("mlAppName" + "-content")
  mlAppConfig {
    modelsDatabase=mdb
    generateInstanceConverter=true
    generateSchema=false
    generateDatabaseProperties=true
    generateExtractionTemplate=true
    generateSearchOptions=true
  }
}

### Transform UML to ES
Next, we move our UML model into ML as an ES model.

gradle -b uml2es.gradle -PenvironmentName=local -i -PmodelName=IMDBMovie uDeployModel

Confirm:
- Content DB has the following documents
  * /marklogic.com/entity-services/models/IMDBMovie.json (The ES model)
  * /xmi2es/extension/IMDBMovie.ttl (Semantic triples that extend our model)
  * /xmi2es/extension/IMDBMovie.txt (A text summary of our model extension)
  * /xmi2es/findings/IMDBMovie.xml (Problems found during transformation)
  * /xmi2es/xmi/IMDBMovie.xml (The original UML model as an XMI document)
- Your gradle directory structure under data/entity-services-dump has the same documents as above.
- Schemas DB still contains just /MovieModel-0.0.1.tdex - our "pre-cooked" TDE template

Check /xmi2es/findings/IMDBMovie.xml for issues during transform. It should not indicate any issues.

Notice we made use of the extended model definition. Specifically, we pasted the contents of /xmi2es/extension/IMDBMovie.txt as a block comment into our conversion module plugins/ext/entity-services/IMDBMovie-0.0.1.xqy. We refer back to that comment in several points in the code, showing that our implementation references facts from the extended model.

- In Query Console, open a tab of type SPARQL, point to the content DB, run the following query, and verify you get any results. This means the ES model is in FINAL and its semantic metadata is populated.

select * where {?s ?o ?p}

Among the results, you should see the following:
- <http://com.marklogic.es.uml.movie/MovieModel-0.0.1/Movie/cast> <http://marklogic.com/entity-services#datatype> <http://marklogic.com/json#array> from basic ES model
- <http://com.marklogic.es.uml.movie/MovieModel-0.0.1/Movie/cast> <http://marklogic.com/xmi2es/xes#relationship>  "association" from the extended ES model

- In gradle project, check for these newly generated files:
  * src/main/ml-config/databases/content-database-GENERATED.json - Generated DB config with indexes specified in model. We will use this.
  * src/main/ml-modules/ext/entity-services/MovieModel-0.0.1-GENERATED.xqy - Generated instance converter. We don't need this because we have the pre-cooked one in the same directory. 
  * src/main/ml-modules/options/MovieModel.xml - Generated search options
  * src/main/ml-schemas/MovieModelPhysical-0.0.1.xsd - Generated XML schema. We won't use this.
  * src/main/ml-schemas/tde/MovieModel-0.0.1.tdex - Generated TDE template. We don't need this. The pre-cooked version is src/main/ml-schemas/MovieModel-0.0.1.tdex 

### Deploy
Deploy these artifacts: DB indexes, modules and schemas. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DELETE THE GENERATED TDE TEMPLATE!!!

Run the following:

gradle -PenvironmentName=local -i useGeneratedDBConfig deleteGenerated mlDeployDatabases mlReloadModules mlReloadSchemas

Confirm:
- Content DB now has element range indexes
- Schemas DB has ONLY ONE tdex document: /MovieModel-0.0.1.tdex

### Ingest
Ingest movie data based on the model

Run the following:

gradle -PenvironmentName=local -i ingestMovieData

Confirm:
- Content DB now has the movie documents. Check the totals per collection. 
  - bio:2
  - company:1
  - movie:5
  - movieDoc:2
  - person:3

If your count is different, it might be because you have two TDE templates. Go back to step 3 and confirm the results.

## Explore Data
In Query Console, import XMI2SMovies.xml workspace. In each tab, try the query to explore an aspect of the data.
